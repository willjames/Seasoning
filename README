Seasoning
---------

One thing that can add a bit of personality to a site is to mess around with the logo occasionally. 
As you almost certainly know, Google do this all the time. Back through the swirling grey mists of 
time, I thought I'd write an utility class providing some date-based functions to automate this. 
After all, if you've gone to the effort of knocking up a Halloween logo, or slinging in some fireworks 
for November 5th, you're probably going to want the same shenanigans next year as well, right? 
And so the Seasoning project was born...

At present, Seasoning is very UK-centric. If you're working on an internationalised site or product, you may be 
wanting one of these for France, or Germany, or the USA, or indeed any country. And this is where the 
community bit of GitHub comes in (at least I'm hoping!). Pull requests for new country utility classes will 
be greatly welcomed, particularly if they come with test coverage. I've specced a French test suite in the 
hope of getting the ball rolling...


Release notes
-------------

v.0.1 - legacy code refactored, tests around UK seasoning, test classes for FR sketched out.


General notes
-------------

British Summer Time (also known as Daylight Saving Time, or DST) start / end rules
		
DST is in force from the last Sunday in March until the last Sunday in October. http://wwp.greenwichmeantime.com/
(spring forward, fall back)

NB changes are made at 1am on the Sunday, so typically you will want to show a "change the clocks" reminder on the day before...

DST is currently under review by the UK government (November 2011).

Define Christmas.... Advent? 12th night?
